## Planning For the Future
We have many plans for the future of the application that will not only make the it more verstatile but more in depth as well. Some of the features include:
* Add a music playing API (such as Spotify) to be able to play music while in the middle of the run created by the app
* Implement a fitness API that will be able to track and display multiple health related statistics such a heart rate, calories, etc... which is connected from something like a smart watch to track those statistics
* Implement an API that will email all the results to you so that you can keep records of the runs
* Implement a feature with the Google maps API that shows the destinations on the roads of sidewalks and gives a clear path to avoid running into lakes or other people's houses
